<h4> Sunday the 3rd of August 2025</h4>
<p1>4.28pm, About to go to work for my last day of this weekend. Just a quick touch in and update. 
    Just installed VsCode, Have installed Github and watched a quick video on how to use it again. 
    Lets hope I do better with it this time. I'm going to try and make a concious effort at learning publically and routinely. 
    I need to hold myself more accountable.
